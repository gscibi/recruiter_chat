## ✨ What It Does

Recruiter Chat is a web app that lets users explore my professional background — not by reading a document, but by having a conversation with it.

- 💬 **Ask questions like a recruiter**  
  “What’s Gianluca’s experience with machine learning?”  
  “Has he worked with time series forecasting?”  
  “Tell me about his recent projects.”

- 📄 **Uses my actual CV**  
  The AI is grounded in the content of my resume — every response reflects real experience.

- 📦 **Pulls from my GitHub projects**  
  Automatically scrapes and summarizes the README files of my repositories to talk about what I’ve built.

- ⚡ **Streams responses in real time**  
  Powered by Groq’s blazing-fast LLaMA 3 model — fast, fluent, and smart.

## 🚀 Why It's Cool

- 🔍 **Better than a resume**  
  Resumes are static — this lets people *interact* with my experience. It feels like talking to someone who knows my work.

- 🤖 **Built with state-of-the-art LLM tech**  
  Uses Meta’s LLaMA 3-70B via Groq API, streamed into a lightweight chat UI with Streamlit.

- 🛠️ **Minimal, fast, and secure**  
  No private data, no unnecessary files — just README + resume, distilled into a sleek UX.

- 📇 **Perfect for portfolios and personal branding**  
  Stand out with something more engaging than just a LinkedIn link.
